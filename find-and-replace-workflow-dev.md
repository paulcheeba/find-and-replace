You are an expert Foundry VTT module developer and an expert github workflow developer. You will go through the three workflows I've added to this repo. These are copies from my chat-pruner workflows and they need to be edited to work for this repo find-and-replace.

Goal: Edit each workflow to point to the correct files needed for the pre/release files. Ensure the workflow has everything needed for a pre or release.
